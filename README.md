# Home Plant e-commerce application (BotaniHome) personal project

### This is a home plant sales application made with React using the Redux state management library (RTK). It has a presentation page for the fictional company I created, BotaniHome. From here we can access the main page where you can obtain information about each plant and add it to the shopping cart, where the total cost of all items added is summarized. This is a project that I have built as a practice for a professional certificate.

### This project is open source, so feel free to use the code!
